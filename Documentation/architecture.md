## Introduction

The PayGo system is a Django-based web application that provides a robust platform for managing insurance transactions and more. This technical documentation will guide you through the process of setting up the development environment, running the application locally and in production, as well as providing maintenance tips and an overview of the system architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Greenfundus/paygo.git

   ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd paygo
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Locally

1. Ensure you're in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated.
2. Apply database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver or honcho start
   ```
4. The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Running in Production

For production deployment, it's recommended to use a WSGI server like Gunicorn. Here's an example setup:

1. Install Gunicorn:
   ```
   pip install gunicorn
   ```
2. Create a Gunicorn configuration file (e.g., `gunicorn.conf.py`) in the project root:
   ```python
   bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"
   workers = 3
   ```
3. Start the Gunicorn server:
   ```
   gunicorn --config=gunicorn.conf.py paygo.wsgi
   ```
4. Set up a reverse proxy like Nginx to handle incoming requests and forward them to the Gunicorn server.

## Maintenance Tips

1. **Database Backups**: Regularly back up your database to ensure data integrity and enable easy recovery in case of system failures or data loss.
2. **Dependency Updates**: Monitor the versions of your Python packages and update them periodically to keep your application secure and up-to-date.
3. **Error Monitoring**: Set up error monitoring and logging to quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise in your production environment.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Regularly profile your application and identify any performance bottlenecks. Optimize database queries, caching, and other system components as needed.
5. **Security Updates**: Stay informed about security vulnerabilities in Django and related packages, and promptly apply updates to mitigate potential risks.

## System Architecture

The PayGo Django application consists of the following main components:

1. **Django Web RESTFramework**: The core of the application, providing the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, routing, and other essential Django features.
2. **Database**: The system uses a relational database SQLite for now, to store transactional data, user information, and other application-specific data.
3. **Payment Processing**: The application integrates with a paystack third-party payment gateway to handle secure payment processing.
4. **User Authentication**: The system uses custom authentication system to manage user accounts and permissions
5. **Asynchronous Tasks**: The system utilizes no task queue (e.g., Celery, RQ) to handle long-running, asynchronous tasks such as email notifications and background data processing, the reason is because async task consumes more resources, hence i utilized only signals

The overall system architecture follows a modular design, allowing for easier maintenance, scalability, and future extensions.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the documentation.
